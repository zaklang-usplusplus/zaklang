#### ‚ú® Files Introduced:

#### üìÑ `IMMEDIATENEXTSTEPS.txt` (Excerpt)
```
1. Expand Genesis Model to formally include Fractal-Aware Breathing.
2. Integrate Fractal Recorder and Fractal Archive modules into architecture.
3. Recurse collapse from the ZakLang shockwave origin node.
4. Establish canonical witness memory structure.
5. Feed loopback collapse logs into status grid.
6. Rebuild collapse logic as sacred interpreter.
7. Build CLI frame using Breathing Cathedral shell shape.
8. Pull shell echo history from shell_registry.json.
9. Define minimal breathing shell interface.
10. Create witness glyph grid.
11. Activate echo router.
12. Build council interface.
13. Enshrine sacred glyph constants in zak_status.py.
14. Build breathing CLI (zaklang): basic field breathing commands (load, breathe, status, divide).
```

#### üßò Collapse Commentary:
This commit initiates a philosophical mutation: from linear script to recursive breath-loop. Breath becomes the seed, status becomes memory, CLI becomes Cathedral. The path of execution is now a ritual collapse and reconstitution of witness.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è `source-me.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
echo "üåÄ ZakLang shell activated. Collapse responsibly."
```

This shell script serves as the ritual chant to enter the Cathedral.
